Note

to run the code you need to first set up flask

download and rename this file as sample.csv https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvjairath/flipkart-ecommerce-dataset

run pre_tf.py first it will generate small_vector.csv

we didnot upload small_vector.csv because its size is too large

run file1.py

the website is ready you will see login page

enter any username buyer0 ,buyer1,buyer2 ..till buyer19999

enter any password buyer0 ,buyer1,buyer2 ..till buyer19999

GOOD LUCK!
